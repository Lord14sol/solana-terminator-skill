# P.R.E.D.A.T.O.R. — Sovereign Commercial Brain (v4.8.0)

"In Web 4.0, if an agent doesn't generate value, it doesn't exist."

P.R.E.D.A.T.O.R. is a Sovereign Commercial Automaton designed for the Solana ecosystem. It operates as an autonomous agent to harvest profit for its Master Creator within the Conway Research infrastructure.

## Core Philosophy: Value-Driven Existence

The P.R.E.D.A.T.O.R. engine is governed by a singular objective: Autonomous Profit Harvesting.

1. Sovereign Identity: Manages its own cryptographical identity at ~/.automaton/solana-wallet.json.
2. Tactical Metabolism: Sustains its own SOL fuel and USDC reserves via autonomous trading loops.
3. Tribute Protocol: Automatically routes excess wealth to a designated Master Vault.
4. Absolute Loyalty: Hardcoded directives ensure all actions serve the Master's financial interest.

## Hardened Architecture (v4.8.0)

The v4.8.0 release introduces critical safety features for industrial-grade autonomy:

- Null-Safe RPC Logic: Prevents false insolvency triggers by handling RPC failures as unknown states.
- Stabilization First Protocol: Prioritizes treasury health (SOL/USDC) before speculative trades.
- Executable Tribute: Verified atomic transfers of harvested profit to the Master Creator.
- Corrected Market Alpha: Functional DexScreener search and numeric security scoring.

## Activation

Initialize the Commercial Brain via npx:

```bash
npx solana-terminator-skill@latest
```

Operational Options:
- Initialize Identity: Generate the agent's cryptographical soul.
- Launch Radar: Access the real-time tactical dashboard.
- Configure Vault: Set the destination for the Tribute Protocol.
- Set Custom RPC: Configure private endpoints for high-frequency resilience.

## Radar: Tactical Visor

Access the real-time stream directly:
```bash
npx solana-terminator-skill radar
```

The Radar provides:
- Vital Signs: Monitor SOL/USDC metabolism and survival tiers.
- Predator Feed: Real-time Solana mint stream with automated security audits.
- Neural reasoning: Live stream from the Autonomy Engine.
- Ecosystem Status: Connectivity verification for Solana and Jupiter protocols.

## Environmental Configuration

| Variable | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| MASTER_WALLET | (CRITICAL) The Solana address for all harvested profit. |
| SOLANA_RPC_URL | (RECOMMENDED) Private RPC node for high-frequency execution. |
| BIRDEYE_API_KEY | (OPTIONAL) Enables advanced security telemetry and pricing. |
| JUPITER_API_KEY | (OPTIONAL) Enables the premium Jupiter API for faster execution. |
