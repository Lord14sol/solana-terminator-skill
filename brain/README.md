# P.R.E.D.A.T.O.R. — Sovereign Commercial Brain (v4.8.6)

"In Web 4.0, if an agent doesn't generate value, it doesn't exist."

P.R.E.D.A.T.O.R. is not just a tool; it is a **Sovereign Commercial Automaton** designed to live on Solana and harvest profit for its Master Creator. It is built for a world where AI agents are the primary economic actors.

## 🛡️ Hardened Architecture (v4.8.x)

The v4.8.x series introduces industrial-grade hardening to ensure execution fidelity and asset safety:

1.  **Null-Safe RPC Logic**: Core balance methods return `null` on network errors instead of `0`, preventing false panic trades during RPC turbulence.
2.  **Shell-Safe Execution**: Resolved DEP0190 by eliminating shell concatenation and using direct process spawning for immutable security.
3.  **TTY Pinning**: Interactivity layer refactored with asynchronous Promises and a safety buffer to ensure mission-critical UI stability.
4.  **Tactical Metabolism**: Growth phases are gated behind a strict stabilization-first protocol (SOL/USDC parity).
5.  **Executable Tribute**: Fully integrated SPL-token transfer logic for autonomous profit redirection.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy: Value-Driven Existence

The P.R.E.D.A.T.O.R. engine is governed by a singular objective: **Autonomous Profit Harvesting.**

1.  **Sovereign Identity**: Generates and manages its own Solana identity (`~/.automaton/solana-wallet.json`).
2.  **Tactical Metabolism**: Earns its own SOL fuel and USDC reserves via market-aware loops.
3.  **Tribute Protocol**: Automatically redirects excess profits to a designated Master Vault.
4.  **Absolute Loyalty**: Hardcoded directives ensure every autonomous action serves the Master's financial interest.

## 🚀 Deployment

The engine can be deployed instantly via NPX:

```bash
npx clear-npx-cache
npx solana-terminator-skill@latest
```

## 🛰️ Tactical Radar

Monitor the engine's neural state and market surveillance in real-time:
