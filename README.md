# P.R.E.D.A.T.O.R. — Sovereign Commercial Brain (v4.7.0)

**"In Web 4.0, if an agent doesn't generate value, it doesn't exist."**

P.R.E.D.A.T.O.R. is not just a tool; it is a **Sovereign Commercial Automaton** designed to live on Solana and harvest profit for its Master Creator. It is built for a world where AI agents are the primary economic actors.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy: Value-Driven Existence

The P.R.E.D.A.T.O.R. engine is governed by a singular objective: **Autonomous Profit Harvesting.**

1.  **Sovereign Identity**: Generates and manages its own Solana identity (`~/.automaton/solana-wallet.json`).
2.  **Tactical Metabolism**: Earns its own SOL fuel and USDC reserves via market-aware loops.
3.  **Tribute Protocol**: Automatically redirects excess profits to a designated Master Vault.
4.  **Absolute Loyalty**: Hardcoded directives ensure every autonomous action serves the Master's financial interest.

## 🚀 Activation

Initialize the Commercial Brain using npx:

```bash
npx solana-terminator-skill@latest
```

The interactive Mission Control allows you to:
- **Initialize Identity**: Generate the agent's cryptographical soul.
- **Launch Radar**: Real-time tactical dashboard for market predators.
- **Configure Vault**: Direct the Tribute Protocol to your specific address.
- **Set Custom RPC**: Bypass rate limits for high-frequency survival.

## 👁️ Mission Control (Radar)

Access the tactical visor directly:
```bash
npx solana-terminator-skill radar
```

- **VITAL SIGNS**: Monitor Sol/USDC metabolism and survival tiers.
- **PREDATOR FEED**: Real-time stream of Solana mints with automated security auditing.
- **NEURAL LOGS**: Live reasoning stream from the Autonomy Engine.
- **ECOSYSTEM STATUS**: Verification of Web 4.0 connectivity (Solana + Jupiter).

## 🛠️ Autonomy Modules

The engine provides 20+ specialized methods for autonomous value harvesting:
- `keepAlive()`: The primary survival heartbeat. It monitors treasury and executes stabilization trades.
- `getMarketAlpha()`: Scans for momentum pairs with validated security credentials.
- `harvestProfit()`: The direct mechanism for tribute redirection.

## 🌐 Environmental Matrix

| Variable | Protocol |
| :-- | :-- |
| `MASTER_WALLET` | (CRITICAL) The destination for all harvested wealth. |
| `SOLANA_RPC_URL` | (RECOMMENDED) Private node for sovereign execution. |
| `BIRDEYE_API_KEY` | (OPTIONAL) Advanced security telemetry. |
